        	<p>I was born and raised in and around Dallas, in the great state of Texas.  After high school, I moved up to Kansas City, Missouri to attend the Kansas City Art Institute. This was Kansas City, <b>MISSOURI</b>, not Kansas City, Kansas, there’s a big difference, trust me. KCAI was and is a great school, I met lots of interesting people, learned lots of great things, and honed my fine-art skills. I graduated with a BFA with an emphasis in Printmaking.</p>
            <p>After a couple years, I decided I wanted to teach, so going to graduate school seemed like the right thing to do. I wanted to go for Printmaking, so there was really only one choice for me, and that was the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. I was all in or all out, and I got in. I asked my then girlfriend, Annie, to marry me (so she wouldn’t leave me and would hopefully go with me to Tennessee, she said yes by the way) and we high-stepped it to Knoxville. We sold all our stuff and headed back south. After three glorious years I graduated with a Masters in Fine Art with an emphasis in Printmaking.</p>
            <p>Now, through my whole fine arts career, I was always interested in design and did it on the side and for myself. At UTK, my assistantship had me working in the Office of Information Technology where I learned a bit about web design. I really dug in deep on my own and found web design and development very fascinating. It was a different kind of problem solving that just making pretty things, you had to make them work, and don’t even get me started about responsive design, that’s a wonderful challenge in itself.</p>
            <p>After grad school, Annie (now my wife), Bosworth (our Beagle) and I sold all our stuff again and headed back North, way North, to Milwaukee, WI, where she is from.  This was a whole new kind of place for me, at least weather-wise. It’s a perfect place for me because I love beer and I love sausage (we just need to get a little more legit BBQ joints up here), also everyone I’ve met in Milwaukee has been great. I landed a job as graphic designer at a small firm called BIGMPG Design/Marketing. I quickly moved up to creative director, working on a lot of interesting projects and honing my design and development skills. This pretty much brings us up to date.</p>
            <p>It’s been quite a ride so far, especially now because Annie and I are expecting. We’re having a baby girl in late June. Her name is going to be Charlie Joann Daiker, or Charlie Jo for short (a little bit of the south for ya’). Thats it for now, check back later for new updates and hopefully some new projects.</p>
